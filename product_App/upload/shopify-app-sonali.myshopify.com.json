In summer, the Laguna aeration kit pumps oxygen into your fish pond, which is crucial for their health, particularly in a densely-stocked pond or during very hot periods when oxygen levels decline.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tOur pond aeration kit provides the fresh oxygen that contributes to a clean and clear aquatic ecosystem, promotes healthy aquatic life, and helps break down fish waste. In winter, air circulation generated by the pump prevents pond surfaces from completely freezing, allowing fresh oxygen to enter the water and toxic gases to escape. This aeration kit aids in producing the gas exchange that is vital for the survival of hibernating fish. The 35 Watt pump generates a powerful and continuous circulation of air for your Koi pond and is extremely quiet and energy-efficient to operate. This aeration kit comes with everything you need and is simple to install. The pump requires no lubrication, has a maximum output of 3000 LPH (793 US GPH) and is rated for outdoor use.\n\t\n\t<br>\n\t<h3>The Laguna Pond Aeration Kit Includes<\/h3>\nMax Output: 3000 LPH (793 US GPH). \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tThe kit includes:  <br>\n\t<br>\n\t35-Watt Air Pump <br>\n\tAir stone (100 mm dia) <br>\n\tChrome-coated metal manifold <br>\n\tAir tubing (4 mm dia) <br><br>\n\t\n\t\tBuy the Laguna Pond aeration kit to protect the delicate environment of your Koi pond and water garden.

sludge-free pond. Bio-Max has the largest surface area and number of pores perfectly sized to allow bacterial colonies to thrive, creating a bacterial sanctuary that maintains a biological balance in pond water. Beneficial bacteria living in micro-tunnels and micro-cavities naturally eliminate ammonia and nitrite, which are toxic compounds that originate from pond inhabitants, decomposing organic matter, and run-off from surrounding terrain.<br>\nTests performed in overloaded pond conditions with live fish showed that Bio-Max rings held 6.9 grams of bacteria, over 400% more than a plastic ball biological

Not only do they add a beautiful aesthetic dimension, they also perform practical functions, such as provide food, shelter and shade for fish, help keep the water\u2019s biological balance, and attract insects for fish to eat. Laguna Planting Baskets are an easy and convenient way to put plants in ponds. Their lattice design allows the free flow of water so that plants receive abundant water supply, and it helps prevent the compaction of roots. Made of sturdy plastic material, the baskets are tough enough to be placed at the bottom of ponds and also light enough to float at the surface, where they are ideal for protecting the roots of floating plants from fish who like to bite on them. All baskets include convenient handles for easy grasping. Planting Baskets are available in several shapes and sizes to meet your needs.<\/p> \n\n<p>Contour Basket. 45 x 18 x 15 cm H (18\" x 7\" x 6\").<\/p>","vendor":"Laguna","product_type":"Aquatic Plant

Their carefully engineered cylindrical design puts pond water \ninto a self-cleaning, highly dynamic \u201a\u00c4\u00faspin cycle\u201a\u00c4\u00f9. This process removes \nthe heaviest debris before it gets to the filter media and ensures that \nthe water is evenly distributed throughout the entire filter chamber. \nThe net result is a filter that operates nearly 3x more effectively than\n those inefficient square filters!<h3><\/h3><h3>Modular Design<\/h3>\n            Savio Livingponds Filters harness the natural dynamics of\n moving water. Adding Filtration is as simple as connecting filters \ntogether. \n            Connect two Versatile Filters to get Filtration up to \n10,000 gallons and 3,000 gph. Connect one Livingponds Versatile Filter \nand one Waterfall Filter to get filtration up to 10,000 gallons and up \nto 10,000 gph flow rate. \n            <h3>Round is Better<\/h3>\n            30% of a square box filter is simply unused corner space,\n the other 70% is active at startup.
